Hi! This is a one-person project which was created for my December 2025 Capstone showcase of my Bachelor's of Business Analytics programme. 
The aim of this project is to spread awareness of Corporate Employee Burnout using a Burnout Risk Calculator whcich is aimed at corporate employees. The project contains 2 main components: Maxhine Learning + Web Development and Data Visualization. 

The Project Life Cycle and the development details are included in the final product (my web-based solution), all you have to do to access my full web-based solution is to: 
1. Download and unzip this file
2. Go to index.html > Go Live, this will open up my Burnout Calculator website
3. Scroll down to the Dashboard Overview Section or click on that "Dashboard Overview" button in my site navigation section on the left.
4. You will see my dashboard overview so just play around with it and flip through my dashboard to view the process of my project development.

*If you guys have any questions about my project, feel free to conntact me, sorry for the lack of details in my github repo. I'm SIGNIFICANTLY sleep deprived! :(
